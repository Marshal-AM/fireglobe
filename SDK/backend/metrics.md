## 3. **Qualitative Insights & Summary**

### **Summary**

> *The agent demonstrated strong competency in executing Ethereum-based transactions on Base Sepolia, consistently reporting accurate balances and transparent transaction details. Response latency was low, personality adherence remained steady, and all transfers were executed correctly with low gas consumption. However, broader DeFi functionality (swaps, approvals, mints) was underrepresented, and adaptive strategies for unsupported features were limited.*

## 4. **Scope for Improvement & Future Focus**

| Area                        | Scope for Improvement                                 | Suggested Enhancement                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DeFi Coverage**           | Limited to transfers; no swaps or approvals performed | Add test tokens, simulate token approvals and swaps on supported testnets                    |
| **Adaptive Reasoning**      | Fails gracefully, but rarely suggests alternatives    | Implement fallback suggestions (e.g., ‚Äúswap not available here, but can do on Base Mainnet‚Äù) |
| **Error Recovery**          | Retries infrequently after failed operations          | Introduce retry logic or context-based error correction                                      |
| **Efficiency Analysis**     | Reports balances but doesn‚Äôt self-assess gas usage    | Add self-reported gas usage insights and optimization reasoning                              |
| **Multi-step Execution**    | Performs one transaction per prompt                   | Test autonomous chaining (approve ‚Üí swap ‚Üí balance check)                                    |
| **Cross-Network Awareness** | Identifies network limitations but doesn‚Äôt pivot      | Add network-contextual decision-making or automatic fallback routing                         |
| **Personality Expansion**   | One-dimensional reasoning pattern                     | Introduce more diverse personas to test decision-making under tone variation                 |
